# Temperature Sensor Repo

My goal with this repo is to provide everything needed for someone to construct and stand up one of the temperature sensor boxes.  This includes the box design, hardware specs, and code.  I will try my best to move in major version chunks together, so that if I make a design change, it is directly reflected in the code, hardware, design, etc., all at once.  Then someone can download a single release and get everything.

# Basics

The temperature sensor kits use this hardware:
- Raspberry Pico W (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BMP5546H)
- DS18x20 temperature sensors with convenient little breakout boards (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NVWNGLQ)
- A 1.8", 128x160, ST7735r color LCD screen (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LSG51MM)
- Some short female-to-female jumper cables (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRTKTV64)
- Short female-to-dual-female splitter jumper cables (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSZWFS1V)
- Screws - I will update this with exact sizes soon, and include links to them

I use Tinkercad to design my 3D printed boxes.  I will try to keep a link to the design up to date here, but for now this is an image:

I use a very small Tina2S 3D printer to print the boxes. (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMHM6XQG)  It has a very small print area, which has forced me to rethink the design multiple times.  For better or for worse.
